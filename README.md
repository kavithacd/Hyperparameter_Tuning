# Hyperparameter_Tuning
A Feature engineering and Hyperparameter tuning project to predict the strength of concrete based on its various properties.

# Context
Concrete is the most important material in civil engineering. The concrete compressive strength is a highly nonlinear function of age and ingredients. These ingredients include cement, blast furnace slag, fly ash, water, superplasticizer, coarse aggregate, and fine aggregate.The actual concrete compressive strength (MPa) for a given mixture under a specific age (days) was determined from laboratory. Data is in raw form (not scaled).The data has 8 quantitative input variables, and 1 quantitative output variable, and 1030 instances (observations).

# Objective
Build a model to predict the strength of the high-performance concrete, given its various properties.
